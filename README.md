# CIFAR-10-Convolutional-Neural-Network
A Convolutional Neural Network with some utilities, such as saving and retraining, for image recognition.

CIFAR-10 contains 60000 images, which are distributed into 10 categories of animals and vechiles.

Using Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries. Achieving 85% accuracy after 35 epochs.

Run main.py to execute the program, or open Cifar10_preview_example.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to preview predictions.
If you are either retraining or previewning, make sure to have the files "cifar10_model.h5" and "cifar10_model.json" in the execution folder.
