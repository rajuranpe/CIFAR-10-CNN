# CIFAR-10-Convolutional-Neural-Network
A simple CCN with some utilities, such as saving and retraining, for image recognition.

CIFAR-10 contains 60000 images, which are distributed into 10 categories of animals and vechiles

[Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf), Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.

Using Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries. 
Achieving 80% accuracy after 50 epochs, optimization TBA.
